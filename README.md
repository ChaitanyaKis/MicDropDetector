Project Description
MicDropDetector.ai is an AI-powered web app that analyzes jokes, roasts, and savage one-liners to rate their Mic Drop Potential‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî so you‚Äôll never drop the mic on a weak burn again.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever roasted someone and then awkwardly wondered‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWas that good enough to drop the mic?‚Äù

Millions (well, maybe dozens) of people suffer from Mic Drop Uncertainty Disorder (MDUD) every day.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built MicDropDetector.ai ‚Äî an AI that judges your joke like a brutally honest stand-up comedian.
It scores burn intensity, punchline timing, surprise factor, and linguistic sassiness‚Ä¶
and then tells you if your roast deserves a mic drop, or just a slow clap.
