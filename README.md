## 💡 Project Description  
MicDropDetector.ai is an AI-powered web app that **analyzes jokes, roasts, and savage one-liners** to rate their **Mic Drop Potential™** — so you’ll *never* drop the mic on a weak burn again.  


## 😏 The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Have you ever roasted someone and then awkwardly wondered…  
> “Was that good enough to drop the mic?”  

Millions (well, maybe dozens) of people suffer from **Mic Drop Uncertainty Disorder (MDUD)** every day.  


## 🤯 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built **MicDropDetector.ai** — an AI that judges your joke like a brutally honest stand-up comedian.  
It scores:  
- Burn Intensity 🔥  
- Punchline Timing ⏳  
- Surprise Factor 😮  
- Linguistic Sassiness 💅  

…and then tells you if your roast deserves a **mic drop** or just a slow clap.
